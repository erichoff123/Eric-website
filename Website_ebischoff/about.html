            Hello, my name is Eric Bischoff and I am currently studying Information Technology at LSU. I thought it would be a good idea to brush up on my HTML and CSS coding skills. This website is a work in progress. Please stay tuned!

              Currently this website is in its early development. I know it looks dated now, but in a few weeks it will look great!
